Know it's ok to not learn something until you need it. </br>

## What I did

I spent my work day working with React-Native. </br>
I have completed my university presentation about Internship Details. </br>
I have completed the first chapter from Designing Data-Intensive Applications book. </br>
I have learned more about reliability, scalability, and maintainability. </br>

```text
Reliability means making systems work correctly, even when faults occur. Faults can
be in hardware (typically random and uncorrelated), software (bugs are typically sys‐
tematic and hard to deal with), and humans (who inevitably make mistakes from
time to time). Fault-tolerance techniques can hide certain types of faults from the end
user.
```

```text
Scalability means having strategies for keeping performance good, even when load
increases. In order to discuss scalability, we first need ways of describing load and
performance quantitatively. We briefly looked at Twitter’s home timelines as an
example of describing load, and response time percentiles as a way of measuring
performance. In a scalable system, you can add processing capacity in order to remain
reliable under high load.
```

```text
Maintainability has many facets, but in essence it’s about making life better for the
engineering and operations teams who need to work with the system. Good abstrac‐
tions can help reduce complexity and make the system easier to modify and adapt for
new use cases. Good operability means having good visibility into the system’s health,
and having effective ways of managing it.

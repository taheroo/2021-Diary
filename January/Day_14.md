Pick Up What They Put Down

## What I did

I have completed reading the chapter "Write, A Lot" and started reading chapter "Pick Up What They Put Down" from ["The Coding Career Handbook by Shawn Swyx Wang"](https://www.learninpublic.org/) </br>
We (Me and my friend [Ahmed Triki](https://github.com/AhmedTriki-IT)) have fixed upload images our personal project</br>
Previously, we managed to save the images in the database which was a bad approach as it takes a long time to load them from the database </br>
Now we are using a thiird party service to upload the images

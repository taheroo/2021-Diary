# January Review

I spent the first two weeks building a mobile pplication with my friend [Ahmed Triki](https://github.com/AhmedTriki-IT) </br>
We were coding about 4 hours daily, we learnt a lot about React-Native. </br>
The application is supposed to get published next month </br>
</br>
I spent the first two weeks of my final graduation internship:

- learning about Agile ( values, principles and frameworks) </br>
- learning about microservices. </br>
- learning more about React-Native. </br>

I read about 100 pages from ["The Coding Career Handbook by Shawn Swyx Wang"](https://www.learninpublic.org/). </br>
</br>
I completed first 6 lessons from "Code With Mosh - The Ultimate Redux Course".

## Failures

- Failed to maintain my reading habit ( 8 pages per day ).
  > :information_source: **Solution**: Try to make reading the first thing you do in the day or try reading after lunch.
- Failed to keep journaling what I did everyday.
  > :information_source: **Solution**: Try to predict what your next day will be like and make a journal for it,</br> and at night you will simply need to modify it to what happened that day.

## Important Dates

- 6 January: I started a business with my friend [Ahmed Triki](https://github.com/AhmedTriki-IT) (mobile application).

Today, I have read the chapter "Learn in Public" from "The Coding Career Handbook by Shawn Swyx Wang". </br>
Now I am more aware about the importance of Learning in Public and building your side projects in public. </br>

"You have been trained your entire life to learn in private. You go to school. </br>
You do homework. You get grades. And you keep what you learned to </br>
yourself." </br>
"There is another way. You can Learn in Public instead. </br>
What do I mean by learning in public? You share what you learn, as you learn </br>
it. You Open Source your Knowledge (Chapter 13). You build a public record </br>
of your interests and progress, and along the way, you attract a community of </br>
mentors, peers, and supporters. They will help you learn faster than you ever </br>
could on your own. Your network could be vast, consisting of experts in every </br>
field, unconstrained by your org chart."

Play Long-term Games With Long-term People

## What I did

Today, I have read the chapters "Clone Open Source Apps", "Know Your Tools" and "Specialize in the New" from "The Coding Career Handbook by Shawn Swyx Wang". </br>

These chapters inspire me to invest time in cloning some applications and to specialize in the MERN Stack. </br>

Also, I have started a new course about React Redux "Code With Mosh - The Ultimate Redux Course". </br>
I used to use Context for state management in React but as I like to specialize more in React, I said let's learn React Redux. </br>

I learned: </br>

- What is Redux ? </br>
  A state management library for JavaScript apps </br>
- Pros and Cons of Redux: </br>
  Pros: Predictable state changes, Centralized state, Easy debugging, Preserve Page state, Undo/Redo, Ecosystem of add-ons. </br>
  Cons: Complexity, Verbosity. </br>

Finally, I have read an amazing Article by Naval, ["Play Long-term Games With Long-term People"](https://nav.al/long-term)
. </br>
if you want to be successful, you have to work with other people. And you have to figure out who can you trust, and who can you trust over a </br> long, long period of time, that you can just keep playing the game with them, so that compound interest, and high trust will make it </br>easier to play the game, and will let you collect the major rewards, which are usually at the end of the cycle. </br>
Long-term players make each other rich </br>

In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich. </br>
Naval: I think that is a brilliant formulation. In a longterm game, it’s positive sum. We’re all baking the pie together. We’re trying to make it as big as possible. And in a short term game, we’re cutting up the pie.
